The basic idea of Snippets is that you have a class that 
via it's attribute is expecting to be mated with an XML 
document that possesses some basic charactaristics.

When mated, the XML and the class can perform several 
basic transformations, with the ability to extend things 
and do complex transformations.

In the

  Resource -> Transform -> Representation
  
model, the Snippet is the definition of the Transform 
phase. The Snippet consumes the Resource, is then run 
(the Transform) and then can be made to spit out the 
Representation.
